The team is committed to using hyperspectral analog conversion technology combined with aerial imagery to identify the AI model of air and river pollution in cities. 
Preliminary development of an air pollution identification model has been carried out. 
The team has collected aerial images of small drones in Chiayi County, Taiwan, and the Yunlin area.
This image is an aerial image of a city flying at an altitude of 100 meters, and recorded PM2.5 and PM10 data in the area. 
There is also an aerial image of the Niu Chou River in Chiayi City, Taiwan. 
The image was taken at an altitude of 60 meters by a small drone, and the river water was sampled to detect its pH, BOD, and COD values. 
These images can be used as datasets for image recognition training

Teams interested in the above datasets and models can send letters to smartcitysp7@gmail.com for discussion
